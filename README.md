# 🚀 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Personal Full-Stack Portfolio Website**!  
This project is a creative blend of design, functionality, and personal storytelling — made with ❤️ and Flask.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

My website has **four dynamic pages** and a secure admin panel — all crafted to tell *my story as a developer* and share my work with the world.

---

### 🏠 1. Home Page

A clean and smooth landing section that introduces **me** 👋  
- Displays a profile photo and links to my socials (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Features a fun animated JavaScript text flipper: `Software Engineer`, `Developer`, `Student`, etc.
- Includes a short "About Me" card section ✨
- Shows my **Skills** with modern slider bars (HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, Python...)

---

### 📰 2. Blog Page

Welcome to my **thoughts** 💭  
- Public users can **browse**, **search**, and **read** blog articles.
- A cool **search modal** lets you live-search articles in style!
- Logged-in admins get 🔧 **Edit**, ❌ **Delete**, and ➕ **Create** buttons to manage posts right from the UI.

---

### 💻 3. Projects Page

This is where I show off!  
- Each project is displayed in a **glassy card** format.
- Each includes:
  - a cover image 📸  
  - GitHub link 🔗  
  - and if available, a **live demo** 🚀  

---

### 📬 4. Contact Page

Let’s connect!  
- Includes a responsive contact form ✉️
- Sends emails directly to me using **Flask-Mail**
- Includes social links too

---
